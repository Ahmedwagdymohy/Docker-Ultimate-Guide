# Abstract 
We have configured a full-pipeline with building and testing tools with specific versions,The Usage of DockerImages gonna ease the process of transfering this images to the server and run locally&on Cloud

# Containarization_Of_Full_Pipeline
1.  Building the First container from Jenkins Image
2.  Building the tools container from Dockerfile 
3.  Connecting the Two containers under the same network bridge




(Format this Text)This arch. can have multiple containers as aslave for Jenkins,ex: We can have two container one running on Linux and one on Windows and Jenkins can interface the pipeline with both based on the commands we choose



# Docker-compose-file
serving Jenkins as a interfacing container and Ci/CD container as the tools we are goin to use

To Build the Docker-compoe file: 
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
